# AITechniquesAssignment
Welcome to HoneyPark! HoneyPark is a playground filled with kids playing, bees busily working and mischief all round!

**Layout**</br>
![Layout](/Images/layout.jpg) </br>

The above is the intended layout of HoneyPark. The main playground is at the center of the park </br>
Positioned at the **top left** there are two kids that will be playing tag. When one kid catches the next kid they switch </br>
roles and chase the opposite person. </br>
Positioned at the **top right** is a bee hive full of busy bees. These bees will travel around honeypark collecting pollen and nectar from </br>
the miscellaneous flowers around and return to their beehive to store it. The bees will not bother the player unless </br>
the player **decides to hit the beehive** if the player does this a swarm of bees will chase and attack the player. </br>
There will also be a lake on the **bottom right** and a forest on the **bottom left**. </br>
At the playground just behind the bench will be an **ant mound** where ants will come out in a line to gather crumbs it finds </br>
around the floor. 

**StoryBoard**</br>
![Layout](/Images/story.jpg) </br>
The above is the storyboard for this assignment. </br>
1) This picture will pan the intro to the left side of the park. </br>
2) This picture will pan the intro to the right side of the park. </br>
3) This picture shows the two kids running around in the park. </br>
4) This camera angle will show the bees collecting pollen and ectar from the flowers. </br>
5) This camera angle will show 1 how the player can attack the beehive. </br>
and part 2 can show how if you choose to do this, you will be attacked by a swarm of bees. </br>
6) This camera angle will show the player being chased by bees. For a gameplay point of view i might implement the choice of </br>
going through a hedgemaze to show how to bees will navigate through it will focusing you. If not the movie will end with the  </br>
player jumping into the lake to save him/herself from th bees attack </br>
EXTRA) I might add Barry Bee Benson from the Bee Movie as an easter egg to this assignment but im not sure how serious we need  </br>
to make this assignment. </br>

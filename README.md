Welcome to HoneyPark! HoneyPark is a playground filled with kids playing, bees busily working and mischief all round!

**Layout**</br>
![Layout](/Images/layout.jpg) </br>

The above is the intended layout of HoneyPark. The main playground is at the center of the park </br>
Positioned at the **top left** there are two kids that will be playing tag. When one kid catches the next kid they switch </br>
roles and chase the opposite person. </br>
Positioned at the **top right** is a bee hive full of busy bees. These bees will travel around honeypark collecting pollen and nectar from </br>
the miscellaneous flowers around and return to their beehive to store it. The bees will not bother the player unless </br>
the player **decides to hit the beehive** if the player does this a swarm of bees will chase and attack the player. </br>
There will also be a lake on the **bottom right** and a forest on the **bottom left**. </br>
At the playground just behind the bench will be an **ant mound** where ants will come out in a line to gather crumbs it finds </br>
around the floor.
